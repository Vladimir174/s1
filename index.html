      My name is , and I am a passionate professional. As leader my core purpose
      is to see people around me inspired to work, grow and innovate every day.
      In practice, as Release Train Engineer, I am orchestrating teams to be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>result-oriented,</li>
      <li>efficient,</li>
      <li>learn from each other and have fun.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I have been recognized by my peers for my determination and my creativity.
      In the 5 years working in ASML, I have received back to back promotions,
      recognized for my hard work and for demonstrating the Care, Collaborate
      and Challenge values. In 2021, ASML nominated me as a potential future
      leader and I passed successfully the Leadership assessment by Korn Ferry.
      ASML invested on my strong profile as people manager and assigned me in
      the Career Acceleration Program (2022), an intensive Leadership program to
      prepare the next generation of leaders.
